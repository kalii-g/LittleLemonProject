        <p>
          Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
          Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a
          modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and
          Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate
          seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
          moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the
          day. Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
          who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning
          a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and
          his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for
          the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
          Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean
          region.
